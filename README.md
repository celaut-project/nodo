# Nodo: Service Orchestration for Distributed Networks

Nodo is a powerful framework designed to streamline communication, management, and orchestration of services 
across a network of computers. 

In [a network](https://github.com/jossemii/distributed-harmony-embracing-cellular-automata) where
services are specialized software components encapsulated within binary files, and nodes represent the computers in 
the network responsible for discovering and establishing connections with other nodes.

Responsibilities:

1. **Service Execution**: Handles service instance requests, balancing the load between running them 
locally or on its peer nodes. This ensures an efficient distribution of tasks and resources across the network, 
optimizing system performance.

2. **Communication Interface**: Provides a robust and flexible interface that enables the services that it executes
to communicate seamlessly with it, ensuring efficient data exchange and coordination.

3. **Service Instance Construction**: Whether it's constructing a service instance locally or requesting it 
from another node, Nodo handles the intricate task of service instantiation, making it a hassle-free process for users.

4. **Address and Token Provisioning**: Offers a streamlined process for obtaining the communication address and 
authentication token of a service required for interaction, enhancing security and accessibility.

5. **Dependency Management**: Takes care of ensuring that services have access to the addresses of their 
dependencies, irrespective of the node on which they are executed, promoting a smooth and efficient service ecosystem.

Nodo is the glue that holds your distributed network of services together, making complex interactions 
simple and efficient.
